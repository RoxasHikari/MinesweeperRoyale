//server sends messages to client:
    updateBoard(xCD,yCD,value) - when client receives it, it should replace the space,
                                    the space should reflect the value
                                    (-1 is bomb, 0 is empty, 1-8 is surrounded by bomb(s))

//client sends messages to server:
    newClickAt(xCD,yCD) - when server receives it, it should handle the click at xCD, yCd
                        - if not a valid click, the server gives no response, and no update
